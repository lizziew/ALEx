ALEx
====
Group: Grace, Lizzie, Ruby, and the smelly and dangerous and quite lovable wumpus

Goals: 
To make an agent in a top-down environment that can understand and execute commands, clarifying them with requests for information, and also answer requests for information. 

Aspects of Project: 
GUI: Representation of 2-D world containing ALEx the agent & objects with various qualities such as those listed below:
	•	color 
	•	shape 
	•	(heaviness/edibility - to add if we have time, they prevent certain actions) 
Text input from users
Language processing to understand commands - specifically sentence parsing and extracting meaning from commands like:
	•	Move the blue triangle 
	•	Move the blue thing to (1,1) 
	•	Eat the banana 
	•	Go to the star 
	•	Tell me where it is 
A way to retain memory of what is being discussed from command to command so it can ask for and receive clarification
Some problem-solving skills so it knows which information to request
How to respond:
	•	I have no idea what you just said... 
	•	Which “blue thing?” 
	•	(Gross! It’s not edible.) 
	•	(It’s too heavy.) 
Timeline for project:

Goals, ranked from theoretically easiest to theoretically hardest.

	•	GUI/world mechanics 
	•	Executing commands 
	•	Understanding and answering questions 
	•	Understanding commands 
	•	Figuring out what information to request to clarify commands 
	•	If we have time, additional properties of objects and how to interact with them (edibility/heaviness/etc)
